Hey,
This program was created in C++ with the help of Microsoft Copilot.
This is my first C++ program which helped me bring my old mechanical keyboard back to life!

The program aim to help with keyboard chatter often occuring in older mechanical keyboards. 
This is done by the program checking intervals between keystrokes:
If the program detects the same exact keystroke occuring more than once in a time span of:
- 300ms for the space bar
- 60ms for all other keys
It blocks the keystroke.

The program intentionally does not have a GUI, but rather a small tray icon you can right-click on to close the program.
